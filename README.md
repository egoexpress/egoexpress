### Björn Stierand @ GitHub

Hi there, I'm Björn. Up here you find all the things I'm currently working on.

For now most repos are for dockerized applications I run on my servers.
Besides that I'm an @indieweb enthusiast and try to contribute some code to that movement, too.

📫 Feel free to reach me on Twitter or by email!
