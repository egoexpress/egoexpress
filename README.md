### Björn Stierand @ GitHub

👋 Hi there, I'm [Björn](https://bjoern.stierand.org/). Here you find all the public open-source stuff I'm currently working on or did in the past.

💾 For now most of the GitHub repos are for **[@awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)** dockerized applications I run on my various servers.
Besides that I'm an **[@indieweb](https://github.com/indieweb)** enthusiast and try to contribute some code to that community, especially some plugins to the [Known](https://withknown.com/) project (although I switched to a static website rendeded from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) notes recently).

📫 Feel free to reach me on [Mastodon](https://social.stierand.org/@bjoern) or by email. I have accounts on various other social networks, but don't use them anymore.
