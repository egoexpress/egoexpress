### Björn Stierand @ GitHub

Hi there, I'm [Björn](https://bjoern.stierand.org/). Up here you find all the open-sourcy things I'm currently working on.

For now most of the GitHub repos are for dockerized applications I run on my servers.
Besides that I'm an [@indieweb](https://github.com/indieweb) enthusiast and try to contribute some code to that movement, especially some plugins to the [Known](https://withknown.com/) project (although I switched to a static website recently).

📫 Feel free to reach me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@egoexpress) or by email!
